# PyTorch Image Models (Customized for my Academic and Research UseðŸ“‘)

This fork of the `timm` library is tailored for academic and research applications, including thesis work and other scholarly pursuits. While it retains the rich feature set of the original repository, this fork emphasizes my own work, reproducibility, and academic documentation.

The repository is especially suitable for:

- **Thesis Projects**: Optimized tools and frameworks for deep learning research in image processing and model optimization.
- **Academic Research**: A modular setup that simplifies adaptation for novel architectures and experimental setups.
- **Education**: Comprehensive resources for learning state-of-the-art (SOTA) image modeling techniques.

This customized version serves as both a practical toolkit and an academic reference, making it a valuable resource for students and researchers working in the field of computer vision.

## Introduction

Py**T**orch **Im**age **M**odels (`timm`) is a collection of image models, layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders / augmentations, and reference training / validation scripts that aim to pull together a wide variety of SOTA models with ability to reproduce ImageNet training results.

The work of many others is present here. I've tried to make sure all source material is acknowledged via links to github, arxiv papers, etc in the README, documentation, and code docstrings. Please let me know if I missed anything.

## Features

### Models

All model architecture families include variants with pretrained weights. There are specific model variants without any weights, it is NOT a bug. Help training new or better weights is always appreciated.

### Other

Several (less common) features that I often utilize in my projects are included. Many of their additions are the reason why I maintain my own set of models, instead of using others' via PIP:

* All models have a common default configuration interface and API for
    * accessing/changing the classifier - `get_classifier` and `reset_classifier`
    * doing a forward pass on just the features - `forward_features` (see [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/feature_extraction))
    * these makes it easy to write consistent network wrappers that work with any of the models
* All models support multi-scale feature map extraction (feature pyramids) via create_model (see [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/feature_extraction))
    * `create_model(name, features_only=True, out_indices=..., output_stride=...)`
    * `out_indices` creation arg specifies which feature maps to return, these indices are 0 based and generally correspond to the `C(i + 1)` feature level.
    * `output_stride` creation arg controls output stride of the network by using dilated convolutions. Most networks are stride 32 by default. Not all networks support this.
    * feature map channel counts, reduction level (stride) can be queried AFTER model creation via the `.feature_info` member
* All models have a consistent pretrained weight loader that adapts last linear if necessary, and from 3 to 1 channel input if desired
* High performance [reference training, validation, and inference scripts](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/training_script) that work in several process/GPU modes:
    * NVIDIA DDP w/ a single GPU per process, multiple processes with APEX present (AMP mixed-precision optional)
    * PyTorch DistributedDataParallel w/ multi-gpu, single process (AMP disabled as it crashes when enabled)
    * PyTorch w/ single GPU single process (AMP optional)
* A dynamic global pool implementation that allows selecting from average pooling, max pooling, average + max, or concat([average, max]) at model creation. All global pooling is adaptive average by default and compatible with pretrained weights.
* A 'Test Time Pool' wrapper that can wrap any of the included models and usually provides improved performance doing inference with input images larger than the training size. Idea adapted from original DPN implementation when I ported (https://github.com/cypw/DPNs)
* Learning rate schedulers
  * Ideas adopted from
     * [AllenNLP schedulers](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/tree/master/allennlp/training/learning_rate_schedulers)
     * [FAIRseq lr_scheduler](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/fairseq/optim/lr_scheduler)
     * SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with Warm Restarts (https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983)
  * Schedulers include `step`, `cosine` w/ restarts, `tanh` w/ restarts, `plateau`
* Space-to-Depth by [mrT23](https://github.com/mrT23/TResNet/blob/master/src/models/tresnet/layers/space_to_depth.py) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04590) -- original paper?

## Results

Model validation results can be found in the [results tables](results/README.md)

## Getting Started (Documentation)

The official documentation can be found at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/timm. Documentation contributions are welcome.

[Getting Started with PyTorch Image Models (timm): A Practitionerâ€™s Guide](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-pytorch-image-models-timm-a-practitioners-guide-4e77b4bf9055) by [Chris Hughes](https://github.com/Chris-hughes10) is an extensive blog post covering many aspects of `timm` in detail.

[timmdocs](http://timm.fast.ai/) is an alternate set of documentation for `timm`. A big thanks to [Aman Arora](https://github.com/amaarora) for his efforts creating timmdocs.

[paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/lib/timm) is a good resource for browsing the models within `timm`.

## Train, Validation, Inference Scripts

The root folder of the repository contains reference train, validation, and inference scripts that work with the included models and other features of this repository. They are adaptable for other datasets and use cases with a little hacking. See [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/training_script).

## Licenses

### Code
The code here is licensed Apache 2.0. I've taken care to make sure any third party code included or adapted has compatible (permissive) licenses such as MIT, BSD, etc. I've made an effort to avoid any GPL / LGPL conflicts. That said, it is your responsibility to ensure you comply with licenses here and conditions of any dependent licenses. Where applicable, I've linked the sources/references for various components in docstrings. If you think I've missed anything please create an issue.

### Pretrained Weights
So far all of the pretrained weights available here are pretrained on ImageNet with a select few that have some additional pretraining (see extra note below). ImageNet was released for non-commercial research purposes only (https://image-net.org/download). It's not clear what the implications of that are for the use of pretrained weights from that dataset. Any models I have trained with ImageNet are done for research purposes and one should assume that the original dataset license applies to the weights. It's best to seek legal advice if you intend to use the pretrained weights in a commercial product.

#### Pretrained on more than ImageNet
Several weights included or references here were pretrained with proprietary datasets that I do not have access to. These include the Facebook WSL, SSL, SWSL ResNe(Xt) and the Google Noisy Student EfficientNet models. The Facebook models have an explicit non-commercial license (CC-BY-NC 4.0, https://github.com/facebookresearch/semi-supervised-ImageNet1K-models, https://github.com/facebookresearch/WSL-Images). The Google models do not appear to have any restriction beyond the Apache 2.0 license (and ImageNet concerns). In either case, you should contact Facebook or Google with any questions.
